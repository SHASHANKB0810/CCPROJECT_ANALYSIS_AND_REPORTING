##  Project Overview

This project is focused on **user feedback analytics** as part of a cloud-based solution. We built a complete pipeline for collecting, storing, analyzing, and reporting user feedback data using modern tools and technologies in the cloud computing ecosystem.

We developed a full-stack web app using **Streamlit** as the front end and **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** as the cloud-hosted backend. Users can submit feedback through interactive forms. The system retrieves and analyzes this data using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, then generates dynamic **PDF reports** using **ReportLab**.

### End-to-End Feedback Workflow
Submit â†’ Store â†’ Analyze â†’ Visualize â†’ Report

## Workflow

1. User submits feedback via the Streamlit form.
2. Data is stored in the cloud using Supabase (PostgreSQL).
3. Feedback is retrieved and processed using Pandas.
4. Visualization of trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
5. PDF report generated for easy sharing and offline access.
