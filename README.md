Project Overview
This project is focused on user feedback analytics as part of a cloud-based solution. We built a complete pipeline for collecting, storing, analyzing, and reporting user feedback data using modern tools and technologies in the cloud computing ecosystem.

We developed a full-stack web app using Streamlit as the front end and Supabase (PostgreSQL) as the cloud-hosted backend. Users can submit feedback through interactive forms. The system retrieves and analyzes this data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, then generates dynamic PDF reports using ReportLab.

Tools and Technologies Used

Tool/Technology	Purpose
Python	Core programming language
Supabase	Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL database
PostgreSQL	Backend database system
Pandas	Data processing and analysis
Matplotlib	Graph and chart generation
Seaborn	Advanced and beautiful visualizations
ReportLab	Dynamic PDF report generation
Streamlit	Web app development and front-end interface
Features
Streamlit Web App Interface
Interactive UI for feedback collection and report access.

Dynamic Feedback Forms
Forms adapt based on the database schema to collect detailed responses.

  Cloud-Based Data Storage
Feedback entries are securely stored in Supabase (PostgreSQL).

  Data Retrieval and Analysis
Processed using Pandas and visualized with Matplotlib & Seaborn.

  Automated PDF Report Generation
Generate and download clean, professional summaries using ReportLab.

  End-to-End Feedback Workflow
Submit → Store → Analyze → Visualize → Report

  Workflow
User submits feedback via the Streamlit form.

Data is stored in the cloud using Supabase (PostgreSQL).

Feedback is retrieved and processed using Pandas.

Visualization of trends using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

PDF report generated for easy sharing and offline access.
