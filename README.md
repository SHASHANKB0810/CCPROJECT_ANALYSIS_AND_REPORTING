Tools Used : 
Python – Core programming language.
Supabase – Cloud database (PostgreSQL) for data storage and sharing.
PostgreSQL – Backend database.
Pandas – Data processing and analysis.
Matplotlib – Data visualization (graphs and charts).
Seaborn – Advanced and beautiful data visualizations.
ReportLab (Platypus) – Generating PDF reports.
Streamlit – Front-end web app framework.

We used the web app using Python and hosted it with Streamlit. For storing and sharing the data, we used Supabase, which provides a common online database built on PostgreSQL. The app allows users to give entries to the database. We designed the input forms to take more details based on our database structure. After users submit feedback, we pull the data from Supabase and use tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze and create graphs. We also used ReportLab to make PDF reports. 

•Built a web app using Python and hosted it with Streamlit.
•Used Supabase to store and share a common database (based on PostgreSQL).
•Made changes to the feedback form to collect more details according to our database design.
•Retrieved the data from Supabase for analytics.
•Used Pandas to process the data.
•Created graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
•Generated PDF reports using ReportLab.
•The whole system makes it easy to collect, analyze and present report and feedback.
The system simplifies the entire workflow: collecting user feedback → storing it → analyzing the data → presenting the results visually and in downloadable reports.
Features
Web interface for submitting feedback entries.
Dynamic forms designed to collect detailed feedback based on database structure.
Retrieve and process user feedback from Supabase.
Visualize feedback trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Generate downloadable PDF reports summarizing the feedback.
User-friendly and interactive web experience.
